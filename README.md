## turning scikitlearn into tidymodels, a walkthrough for UbiOps

In this walkthrough (See blogpost [here](https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/blog/2021/07/06/walkthrough-ubiops-and-tidymodels/)), I use an existing example in the [UbiOps 
cookbook](https://ubiops.com/docs/ubiops_cookbook/scikit-deployment/index.html ) that uses scikitlearn in python and create a similar thing 
with tidymodels in R.

In this project you can find
* log.md (a log of the actions I took, this is more or less for me, but you might find it interesting too.)
* python/  a folder with the unpacked scikit deployment from the cookbook, which downloads from https://github.com/UbiOps/cookbook  I don't know for sure what the license is for that repo.
* r/ a folder with the predictor_package code, preprocessing_code and training_package folders
